<!-- 1-> Typescript gives us a better development experience. It adds certain features to the code and helps us avoid unwanted errors.For example lets say we have a function which takes in 2 numbers as parameters(num1,num2)and returns the addition of both(num1+num2). Now, if we pass number values to this function as arguments it will return the addition of those two numbers in javascript, which is what we want. But suppose if the one of the arguments is passed, lets say, the string value of 1 ('1') then javascript will concatenate it with the other value and it will become a string ('1' + 8 = '18') which is something to look out for. Typescript keeps a check during runtime for these unwanted errors. Ofcourse, we can use an if statement and then check whether one or both of the values is a string but that just means we are writing extra piece of code.



2-> Typescript adds a bunch of things to javascript: 



a) Types

b)Next gen javascript features

c) Non javascript features like interfaces or generics

d)Meta programming features like decorators

e)rich configuration options

f)Modern tooling that helps even in non typescript projects





3-> We need typescript compiler so that the code can be compiled to javascript and then run in the browser because typescript by itself cannot run in a browser. 

4-> When we compile our app.ts file we see an app.js file get created.

5->He got an error because the defined type was a number but the function was invoked by passing in strings as argument.
